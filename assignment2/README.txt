I really enjoyed working on this assignment. It was fun to write code for the different calculations we’ve learned in class, and to see how everything connects.
I’ve tried to explain my solutions clearly in the PDF. I wasn’t completely sure how much of the code needed to be included or explained in the report, but I hope I’ve done it the right way with the comments.

I hope my Jacobian calculations are correct. I feel like it's easy to to small mistakes with all the expressions, but I did my best. 
I know I probably should have calculated the determinant of J_v by hand, and I think I could have, but it took a lot of time and I wanted to focus on the parts I found more difficult.

I also tried to follow the feedback from the last assignment, especially in Task 3b. I hope I calculated the theta-angles correctly there.

Overall, it was a good learning experience and I’m happy with what I managed to do!
