This assignment has been both challenging and rewarding. 
Understanding the Christoffel symbols and how they contribute to the Coriolis term was initially confusing, and I hope that I solved task 2c correctly with it. 
I also had a confusion with the inertia tensors and their coordinate frames and how to set up the rotation matrices, but I think I understood it after looking at the figure in the assignment. 

In Task 1, I hope I have correctly understood that there is no linear kinetic energy for the first link, since it only rotates and its center of mass does not translate. 
Similarly, I think that link 2 has no rotational kinetic energy because it is modeled as a point mass. Apart from that, I found Task 1 to be pretty manageable and straightforward to implement. 

I think I could have structured the code even better by organizing more parts of it into reusable functions, but I think its more clear to do it like I did, with each task separated.
